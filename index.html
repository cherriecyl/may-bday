                <h2>Hello dearest May!</h2>
                <p>On this special day, I'm sending you lots of love over the interwebs! <br/><br/></p> 
                <p>Made you this little something to celebrate how special you are. HOPE YOU LIKE IT (you better). (Here is further evidence that I'm deep in a computer rabbit hole and haven't seen much of the outdoors in the past while.)<br/><br/></p>
                <p>Despite all the weirdness currently happening in the world, I hope that you're still able to enjoy a peaceful and soul-nourishing day.<br/><br/></p>
                <p>I'm looking forward to when we get to hang out lots in person, and we'll sip tea and build businesses and plan road trips. (Maybe 27 will be the year you get your driver's license? Haha.)<br/><br/></p>
                <p>I cannot wait to see what new personal, spiritual, professional, physical territories you'll venture into this year! Don't forget to take care of yourself and take it easy. <br/><br/></p>
                <p class="label">Lots of love, Cherrie</p>
